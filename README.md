# DAW-recording-correction
AI solution that suggests and applies corrections to an artist's voice or instrument DAW recordings

## Summary
Create a system that will suggest and apply corrections to the recordings of a singer or instrument player.

## Background
The voice or instrument recording of an artists can contain flaws.  
The option to manually edit the recordings and make corrections, requires passions, experience and often many working hours.
The problem is common mainly among inexperienced artist and hobbyists that make their first steps into home-recording and music production.
Music, as well as technology is my hobby, and I would love to combine the two in order to help myself as well as new artists with limited financial recourses to develop close to professional recording and production results.

## Data and AI Techniques
Training Data
  * Previous close to perfect voice recording of the artist’s singing.
  * Previous close to perfect samples of a specific  instrument’s recordings

AI Techniques
  * Neural networks for the voice recordings
  * Neural networks or even convolutional neural networks for the voice recordings

## How it is used
The solution can be used by professionals or hobbyists as a plugin/add-on with mainstream DAWs, for either studio or home-studio recording and production.
Professional Sound Engineers could be affected by the implementation of this solution, in both negative and positive ways.
Hobbyists will be affected in a positive way by the implementation of this solution.

## Chalenges
It is possible that this solution will not be able to accurately “correct” voice recording of artists that cannot provide sufficient training data (close to perfect recordings).
It will initially not be able to suggest and apply corrections if the recording flaws are too “serious” to be corrected. The outcome can be surprisingly unacceptable. 

## What's next
The project could become something even more if the solution is implemented in real-time performances.
